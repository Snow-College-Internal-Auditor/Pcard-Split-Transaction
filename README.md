# Pcard-Split-Transaction
Script that will pull a pcard file and summarize it into a data base with only split transactions with a total ammount higher the $4998. 
Currently to change the orginal file to pull the user has to go to the code to change the path file. Also, the file that saves the path file for that
has to be changed by hand in the code. Working on changing that.
